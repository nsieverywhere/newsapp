Is that an error path or a success path?  It’s both!  The logic is “if we found a rule <i>or</i> if there was an error then return a tuple that hopefully indicates the outcome”.  If any further code were to be added in this block, it would have to be validated for the success and the error case.<p>But this only makes any sense at all if one is okay with reading Go result returns in their full generality. A canonical Go function returns either Success(value) or Error(err not nil, meaningless auxiliary value).  And this code has “meaningless auxiliary value” != nil!  In fact, it’s a pointer that likely escapes further into unrelated error handling code and thus complicates and kind of lifetime or escape analysis.<p>I don’t use Go, but if I did, I think this part of the language would be my biggest peeve.  Go has very little explicit error handling; fine, that’s a reasonable design decision.

Though I was still entirely too cynically skeptical to risk my own money, I was cautiously optimistic that some interesting shakeups could be in the works.<p>As it turns out, crypto was still entirely too much of a closed system to sustain shocks like this, assets entirely too correlated with each other, fraudsters entirely too prevalent, many who were entirely too ready to throw the baby out with the bath water when it came to ignoring lessons learned by traditional finance, and on and on.<p>I think part of what this all reveals is that blockchain transparency of coin transactions is not enough. The rebuilding phase to come needs to focus on the next level up. A blockchain providing a level of brutally clear transparency into all the layers of their own dealings that operating on top of or along side of or in connection to coins&#x2F;tokens. This is needed for all of the somewhat centralized entities that are useful (and, IMHO necessary) to reduce friction &amp; increase usability of crypto.<p>^^Regarding that, maybe it&#x27;s not even a problem that tech can, by itself, solve.  Though often derided, legalese is professional jargon that has developed over the course of centuries in an attempt to minimize ambiguities in transactions between people, and <i>we still</i> need courts with human judgement to sort things out around edge cases, oversights, etc. It may simply be impossible to solve, at least at the level of &quot;code is law&quot;, issues like we see with FTX and its contagion to all levels of crypto that were (either deliberately or in good faith) not operating carefully.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m conflicted on the topic, as perhaps the above rant-ish ramblings show. I was rooting for this generation of crypto tech to take hold as it shook off the scammers and other barnacles of the industry, rooting for it to find a bridge to utility with the actual economy, but even as I rooted for things to go well I am unsurprised by this outcome.<p>I think what it comes down to is that the folks who really want to make this happen and change the way financial systems run society (rather than <i>only</i> to become rich themselves) need to take a step back reassess their philosophy. They need to determine if technology really can address the goals derived from their philosophy. If it can then they start the hard work of building it. If it can&#x27;t, then there&#x27;s the even harder work of pruning away the goals derived from their philosophy that can&#x27;t be achieved by tech, software, etc.<p>For myself, the core part of the philosophy that I think is fundamentally flawed is the &quot;trustless&quot; pillar. I think it may be fundamentally impossible to build something systemic to the infrastructure of society that does not, at a fundamental level, also rely on trust to one degree or another. Bruce Schneier&#x27;s book <i>Liars and Outliers</i> is an excellent exploration on the topic of trust, and it&#x27;s hard to come away from that book &amp; still believe in the vision of a truly trustless financial system which, at some level, underpins a great majority of our lives.","time":1668448034,"type":"comment","_id":"2gKJ87JFRR59eQ82"}

It&#x27;s about how we feel, so let&#x27;s talk about that.<p>Look, everyone is scared of doing something until they&#x27;re scared of not doing it. Everyone distrusts government until they trust it, and distrusts pharma until they trust it. Some people will wear their mask in the grocery store even though it&#x27;s a cloth mask that&#x27;s as good as doing nothing because now it feels weird not to. Some people won&#x27;t take the COVID vaccine but they&#x27;ll happily take remdesivir and ivermectin. (Who do you think makes remdesivir and ivermectin?) Some people will happily go to an indoor comic convention that&#x27;s an hour&#x27;s drive from them, but not to an outdoor wedding, because it would mean getting on a plane (this actually happened with a family member of mine and I am not over it).<p>All of which is to say that what people are really doing is going with their gut. If your gut instinct is &quot;COVID&#x27;s not a big deal&quot;, then of course taking an emergency-use-authorized vaccine for it seems risky. If your gut instinct is &quot;COVID is dangerous and deadly&quot;, you&#x27;ll take anything you can get. Now that things are subsiding, and the fear is waning, I read an article like this and I think &quot;hmm, that does seem bad, we should look into it, but also I am gonna keep doing what I&#x27;m doing and getting my COVID vaccine because it seems like it&#x27;s helping.&quot; On the other hand, you have people who are <i>literally dying of COVID</i> who are still relieved they were able to dodge getting the vaccine because it felt scary to get a not-fully-tested drug.<p>So I&#x27;m pro-vaccine because they seem like a good idea and my experiences with them (four shots so far) have been positive, in that my side effects were limited and I know there were situations where I could have gotten COVID and I didn&#x27;t. (And when I did get COVID, it was extremely mild.) Who&#x27;s to say how I&#x27;d have felt if I were one of the few cases of myocarditis out there? Who&#x27;s to say how I would&#x27;ve felt if I&#x27;d had mild COVID and recovered from it pre-vaccine? What if I&#x27;d been hospitalized with COVID pre-vaccine?<p>Can we just admit this isn&#x27;t about logic or statistics, and never was?

HR interferes too much in the process. They sometimes change the job requirements, sometimes ignore candidates that we explicitely tell them to follow up with, sometimes extend meaningless offers just to keep potentially good candidates in the hook (people with offers at other Big Co.), sometimes force candidates to accept offers without a signed paper, so on and so forth.

Like the approximately 125,000 Japanese Americans imprisoned until after the end of World War Two, they lost any chance of reclaiming the property.<p>Absolutely disgusting that it took the United States 50 years from 1942 to acknowledge injustices like this had occurred as well as disburse the funds in an attempt to correct its mistakes. It was $20,000 in the 1990s, yay whoopee... I have friends whose families still, to this day, do not forgive the American government for what it did. A good majority of grandparents&#x2F;parents were dead by then. Many returnees from the camps systematically tried to erase any cultural heritage they had by purposely hiding it and not passing it on to future generations, as a result of their treatment. Because of that, many Japanese perceive Japanese Americans from that time period as cultureless. Btw, the 442nd Regiment, comprised of Japanese Americans, received the most awards in U.S. history for military service in WW2.<p>Then you take into account the loss of capital from Nagasawa losing his vineyard, and it gets even worse.","time":1668444355,"type":"comment","_id":"7AWS2m8wFnTEvif3"}

If it succeeded or failed, I learned something. Somewhere along the way, I lost the joy of discovery. If you have lost the joy of discovery, consider changing something about your situation, and possibly getting professional help.<p>A lot of the things we say about mentality are descriptions of the human experience, not mechanical or causal elements in the mind. Procrastination is not a cause for delaying tasks, it is just a description of delaying tasks - it is not one thing, the same way plastic or cancer is not one thing. There are many elements and many causes, and you have to address those things, and not the procrastination.<p>Willpower is similar - people talk about willpower like it is a substance that is used up to motivate decisions. That is a human experience, but any particular decision has it&#x27;s own motivations. If you have consistent issues with a type of decision, look into your motivations and deeply held beliefs, look into the elements of that motivation; defer judgement about yourself during this process.<p>These things about mentality can&#x27;t be conveyed with words, your mind has to come to them on it&#x27;s own, but hopefully reading this will make the ideas more available to you.","time":1668434965,"type":"comment","_id":"9S7PJGruf7yNK0A3"}

Some of us are preparing for the worst because the people in office, and appointed are not doing their jobs and have in many respects violated their oaths of office simply by inaction.<p>Technology Sectors have for the most part given up on a reasonable standard division of labor and are now actively seeking to automate jobs away. Rather than augment existing labor many are simply replacing labor with AI without understanding the caveats. They will pay for that mistake, but when you have a coordinated effort to do that finding alternatives will be rough so its a perfect time to start a company (if you know how, and can overcome that barrier to entry).<p>Inevitably the first jobs to go are the more expensive mid-tier jobs. The second are the low end.<p>So there are many reasons you should be very concerned. Not owning a house will set you back on building financial wealth because those tax breaks are not open to you, and the housing market has been inflated beyond what anyone should pay. There will be a crash in the housing market, now is not a good time to buy.<p>A lot depends on what you mean by upskilling, certificates are not that great at upskilling.<p>What&#x27;s worse, all the money you had is worth significantly less today than previously. In the last 2 years you&#x27;ve lost roughly 1&#x2F;5th of your buying power in saved income, and this is expected to continue into the near future.<p>Hyper-inflation is one of the worst taxes the government can impose, counterparty currency and banking risk have never been higher, especially now that we no longer have fractional banking (look at the reserve requirements the fed imposes on banks since 2020, 0% now) but you also can&#x27;t just put everything into a solid commodity like gold&#x2F;silver because the spot price is heavily suppressed and you can&#x27;t easily exchange it without taking a loss on taxes from maintaining your purchasing power&#x2F;stock.<p>In a hyper-inflation environment, the only thing you can do is to invest in assets that will maintain their value for sale, or are goods you will use yourself. Your costs from goods will continue to rise with inflation, this includes rent, so growing food&#x2F;properly canning&#x2F;etc will allow you greater financial flexibility.<p>For mental health, its important to step away from the echo chambers during these times. Focus on what&#x27;s important, practice meditation (stilling your thoughts), and other destressors. Stop giving the 150% you may be doing and limit it to %100 when you are on-the-clock.","time":1668448584,"type":"comment","_id":"9jcHpKbnrG6D8dfW"}

The challenge of maintaining the community + maintaining some sort of an SLA is very hard.

{"by":"PaulKeeble","id":33597941,"parent":33596546,"text":"Multiple times I have found the impact of cache performance to be dramatic. I find that the usual optimisations in three aspects are usually obvious to achieve and can bring surprisingly big improvements.<p>The first is that RAM accessed randomly or in the wrong direction performs very poorly compared to sequential access in order. The same is true of cache because its much easier to predict and prefetched data when its accessed serially. The effect is so dramatic that its sometimes worth &quot;accessing&quot; data you don&#x27;t need to get access to this hardware optimisation to maintain serial access. At times for example I have found Treemaps and listmaps perform better than hashmaps as the cheap search serially and in memory order surprisingly out does the O(log(n)) or O(n) algorithms and the cost of the hash.<p>If you have a data structure that is larger than optimal and overflows cache lines it can have big impacts on cache utilisation and performance if the algorithm doesn&#x27;t need all the fields. Object orientation impacts quite heavily on this and certain designs can make very large objects and these often get poor cache usage.<p>Unnecessary allocation and deallocation of memory in algorithms often results in the cache getting thrashed and avoiding this and using the same memory can result in better hot cache usage and reducing garbage collection usage.<p>Most profilers can give you a good idea of the allocations but the other two are often harder to find and mostly just show up in cache misses.","time":1668448048,"type":"comment","_id":"DmOIux1AxgIBYADb"}

From Wikipedia,<p>&gt; Several leading Wall Street bankers met to find a solution to the panic and chaos on the trading floor.[14] The meeting included Thomas W.

Mitchell, president of the National City Bank of New York.[15] They chose Richard Whitney, vice president of the Exchange, to act on their behalf.[citation needed]<p>&gt; <i>With the bankers&#x27; financial resources behind him, Whitney placed a bid to purchase 25,000 shares of U.S. Steel at $205 per share</i>, a price well above the current market.[16] As traders watched, Whitney then placed similar bids on other &quot;blue chip&quot; stocks.<p>&gt; On October 28, &quot;Black Monday&quot;,[17] more investors facing margin calls decided to get out of the market, and the slide continued with a record loss in the Dow for the day of 38.33 points, or 12.82%.[12]<p>&gt; On October 29, 1929, &quot;Black Tuesday&quot; hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors. The panic selling reached its peak with some stocks having no buyers at any price.[18] The Dow lost an additional 30.57 points, or 11.73%, for a total drop of 68.90 points, or 23.05% in two days.[19][20][21][22]<p>...<p>&gt; Many people blamed the crash on commercial banks that were too eager to put deposits at risk on the stock market.[49]<p>&gt; In 1930, 1,352 banks held more than $853 million in deposits; in 1931, one year later, 2,294 banks failed with nearly $1.7 billion in deposits<p>Does any of this sound familiar?","time":1668444325,"type":"comment","_id":"Fpt0DdPIYlrKJDxr"}

And in the old days, for several centuries, the laws regarding libel and slander mattered, but of course at the moment they are not being aggressively pursued. Nowadays you can go on Twitter and say that Hillary Clinton runs a child sex ring out of a pizza restaurant in Washington DC, and Clinton is not allowed to bring a libel suit against Twitter because of Section 230, nor would it be fruitful for her to file thousands (or even millions) of suits against the anonymous people who post that particular rumor. And so, for all practical purposes, the normal laws regarding libel have been suspended. And yet people still need some way to defend their reputations against lies.<p>Do you want people to set up personal websites?<p>The answer is obvious: repeal Section 230.<p>Once Section 230 is gone, sites such as Twitter and Facebook will simply cease to exist. They will either shut down on their own, or they will be sued into oblivion.<p>Everyone would be forced to set up their own website, and then take full legal responsibility for what is posted to that website.<p>Once Section 230 is gone, then the normal rules of libel come back into force, as they existed for several centuries. Some extremists might regard this as censorship, but for several centuries the normal laws of libel were not regarded as censorship.<p>A civil society can only prevail where people are required to take full legal responsibility for the things they say in public spaces.<p>At the current moment, our laws regarding libel are made almost useless because the publisher of the lies are protected by Section 230, and going after each anonymous individual, when thousands or even millions of people are repeating the lie, is too burdensome for even wealthy individuals to pursue the cases. When wealthy people ask their lawyers &quot;Can I sue?&quot; the lawyers remind them of the Streisand effect:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Streisand_effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Streisand_effect</a><p>I do not know what will happen in the future, but I am certain the current set of arrangements cannot survive. People must have some way of defending their reputations, and the traditional way of doing so has been through our laws regarding libel and slander.<p>To my mind, the most obvious way forward is to repeal Section 230. Large sites such as Twitter and Facebook would likely vanish, and people would then be forced to set up personal websites, and they would be responsible for everything said on those websites. Like newspaper publishers, they could publish many writers, if they wanted to, but they would face the normal legal burdens of libel law, just like every newspaper.","time":1668447132,"type":"comment","_id":"G3LLio4zHpnRGS1m"}

I had to ask them to test for myopericarditis, because they were pretty much only considering an embolism or a panic attack. In that sense I was lucky that I had read a paper a month or so before, indicating young men (such as myself) as having an increased risk after Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. After diagnosis I had to go through a 3-month medication regimen which, I&#x27;ll be honest, wasn&#x27;t all that fun for my intestinal tract.<p>Thankfully I was deemed healthy after half a year, with low probability of lasting damage. Yet, the psychological weight of being confronted with heart disease in your mid-twenties is heavy. My opinions on vaccinations haven&#x27;t really changed, though I think the legal and societal pressure to get everyone vaccinated was out of line and that opinion has gotten stronger. Especially after knowing that vaccination doesn&#x27;t affects transmission as much as they hoped, I expected them to focus much more heavily on the at-risk groups, but that didn&#x27;t happen.<p>The worst part about all of this though is the obstinate denial my cardiologists had of any possible relation between my Pfizer shot and the pericarditis. They&#x27;d point to the fact that young men can develop myopericarditis without vaccination. This is true, though it&#x27;s almost always the result of an infection, and in my region of the world the vast majority of these cases result from flu infections. However, when I had my diagnosis there were barely any flu cases in the country, it just wasn&#x27;t the season, and most of all I wasn&#x27;t ill. Pointing to the close proximity to the vaccination was met with immediate and absolute denial.<p>I think that&#x27;s what bothered me most: I did my part, I tried to protect society by getting a shot, but when confronted with negative fall-out I had to fight for a diagnosis and was pretty much laughed out of the room for suggesting a relation to the booster. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve processed this yet. It really feels like I did everything I was told, giving up much of my hobbies, social life etc., but when my health was on the line... &quot;Ho pal, can&#x27;t be saying anything that could be contorted into criticism of vaccination&quot;.<p>Little of it seemed &quot;fair&quot;.","time":1668455462,"type":"comment","_id":"HZWrpkES9wWOPYKd"}

This lets authors publish at their own pace (which we can assume is relatively slowly) and doesn&#x27;t burden the user with checking for new content manually. Of course, Twitter is a de facto RSS feed for some, and several other services (HN included) serve that role to some extent. But for the personal web, for those readers (and writers) of the web, you need RSS.<p>The other problem is that a lot of writing is just not very good. Perhaps contraversially, I think that too is a tool problem: I&#x27;ve noticed that good authors take more time with their posts, get more feedback from more people, and even go to the trouble of thanking them in the post - which for very popular authors, like pg for example, is quite effective motivation and reward. But most authoring tools don&#x27;t particularly encourage this behavior, preferring instead to give the author the least resistance possible to publishing.<p>So, with either the return of Google Reader or equivalent, or the addition of a great RSS reader in Chrome, plus authoring tools that promote collaboration and revision, the personal web can flourish.

And as I always worked from home as software engineer, so my income went up while cost stayed more or less equal (with some inflation, however even this year, things here didn’t really get more expensive for us outside gasoline).<p>Anyway; for me, owning a house removed all the (unfounded) money worries I had while renting.","time":1668418498,"type":"comment","_id":"HhmWyE7X6l37mdkw"}

This enables you to overpay a mortgage once you have one, and&#x2F;or be resilient to loss of income due to layoff , or increase in costs.

Answered a lot of questions I&#x27;ve had as I toy with the idea of making part of a C++ project in Rust.<p>Regarding Slint and all the other new GUI toolkits, one thing I don&#x27;t understand is why they all seem to completely ignore any controls more complicated than the basics (buttons, checkboxes, drop downs, spin controls, sliders, radio buttons, and a basic list control).<p>A To-Do app is a proof of concept, not an endgame.<p>Beyond those basics I need combo boxes, date time pickers, color pickers, font pickers (fonts are hard, I get it, but my users expect access to system fonts), dockable windows, splits, tabs, modal dialogs, tooltips, masked text input, auto completion text input, context menus, calendar controls, file and directory pickers.<p>Some of the new toolkits offer an assortment of these, including Slint but they rarely get all of them but the biggest thing missing from pretty much all of them are sophisticated data grids (both list and tree varieties). They need support for custom cell rendering, custom cell edit controls, and variable row heights. They also need to be fast even with tens of thousands of rows.<p>Oh, and think about your printing story. You don&#x27;t print a UI obviously but if I&#x27;m rendering diagrams and stuff using your rendering facilities I at least need a way to hook them up to the platform&#x27;s system without just duplicating all of the drawing to a completely different rendering API to make printing work.<p>This isn&#x27;t a dig on Slint. I&#x27;m eagerly watching it, along with egui, as I desperately look for a cross platform alternative to all the legacy stuff I&#x27;m neck deep in.

Or ONE serious study partner.<p>- <i>Learn</i> in the public. Pick a subject, force yourself to write and share summaries, notes, etc. publicly. And promise the next &quot;issue&quot; on a set date.<p>- Rather than finding a subject, find a person who matches one of your interests and learn that with them. Having a person keeps you motivated. And not continuing makes you lose face. I always wanted to learn German and Spanish. I am finally putting effort for German because I have recently reconnected with a friend who learned German in college. I started learning Guitar recently even though I am more interested in Piano because I have a friend who came back to town who is an okay guitarist, and can teach me regularly, rather than having to rely on Skillshare courses.<p>- Timeblock specific days and times of the week. Hell or high water, do that.<p>- Having specific goals help.  &quot;Have enough knowledge about this so I can write a Quora article in it&quot;, &quot;Know enough about Fast Fourier Transform to be able to code it in Python and explain to a college Freshman&quot;, &quot;know enough of X to be able to do Y&quot;. This removes the initial inertia.<p>- Another very helpful thing is- just starting. If you just start doing something you have waited for long to start you are building more inertia, and adding newer items. My advice to you and myself is to just start. When you start, you actually stop liking ~70-80% of the topics. That way you remove clutter. When you haven’t started something, you have a rosy picture of that.

Example of a bad bullet point (Used javascript to build a user-facing dashboard). Example of a good bullet point (Built a new dashboard product that manages x for y number of users. Ultimately drove z result.<p>* Tweak your resume details over time. Don&#x27;t blindly apply to 100+ roles with the same resume. Not only could there be something wrong with it that&#x27;s throwing off employers, it doesn&#x27;t serve you as well as it could. If it&#x27;s a full stack role, highlight more of those skills in your resume. If it&#x27;s a iOS role, make sure more mobile experience is called out. Note: this doesn&#x27;t mean filling it with things that aren&#x27;t accurate about your background.<p>* Don&#x27;t underestimate a solid cover letter (especially for smaller companies) and also reaching out to recruiters at those companies. Both of these things should take &lt; 15 mins.<p>* Have a skills section somewhere on your resume that lists the technologies you are familiar with. This is critical to get passed resume screeners and it also helps free up your experience section to list more accomplishment details than technology ones.<p>* Leetcode, leetcode, leetcode. I know it sucks and it feels like a waste of time but your point of &quot;several places where I was rejected after either the initial or tech screen&quot; makes me feel like you could use some work here. Try to do as many mediums as you can. When I&#x27;ve been deep in interview mode, I try to solve 1 medium problem&#x2F;day every single day. I set a 45 minute time and make sure I can get something working in that time. If I fail, I study the answer and get ready for the next day. After 1-2 months you should be in good shape.<p>Hope this helps!","time":1668449409,"type":"comment","_id":"NzUecuYxphyw4oXA"}

In fact, not a single country with large oil and gas reserves and an active export industry wants to see their revenue collapse due to something like an international ban on the trade in fossil fuels - and this is true regardless of their political ideology, i.e. capitalism vs socialism or authoritarian theocracy or whatever.  Venezuela, the United States, Norway, Iran, Russia, Saudi &amp; UAE, etc. all want to keep running their export programs for the next three decades at least.  I mean, in the USA the Obama Administration oversaw the fracking boom for eight years and now that&#x27;s the basis of the LNG exports to Europe.<p>As far as tracking the big polluters, that&#x27;s more misdirection.  Yes, it&#x27;d be nice if oil refineries were run tightly enough that they had no local emissions, but those refined products are all going into the fuel tanks of jet planes, ships, trucks, power plants and personal vehicles, from whene they will be combusted to CO2 and injected into the atmosphere, so does it really matter where the emissions take place?  This is not rocket science, just basic accounting.  The end result is the same, here&#x27;s a model of the yearly cycle:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04</a><p>If countries had really wanted to slow fossil-fueled global warming, they&#x27;d have started a 1% per year replacement program (renewables for fossil fuels) in the 1980s, and we&#x27;d be at a ~40% renewable ~60% fossil energy mix by now (at least).  As it stands today, every single fossil fuel company and nation-state producer is looking to maintain current production levels for the next 30 years, if they can manage it.  Enough with the hypocrisy and two-faced posturing at these &#x27;global climate meetups&#x27;, already.<p>Finally, this &#x27;hope&#x27; business is ridiculous.  The tipping point has come and gone, there are numerous global carbon models and observational data showing that even with 100% renewables tomorrow, warming will steadily continue due to permafrost melt and carbon outgassing from marine sediments.  The last time CO2 levels were this high was in the Pliocene, ~2-5 million years ago, and that&#x27;s where the climate is heading.  Hence, human civilization will just have to adapt to these new conditions, which will be difficult and expensive and disruptive.  However, since noticeable changes in climate (i.e. clearly distinguishable from the noise in the data) only appear on a ~10 year running average, this could be accomplished, with massive infrastructure projects.<p>However, making efforts to adapt to new conditions would require admitting that fossil fuels drive global warming, which would create more pressure to switch to renewables, and that would be resisted by entrenched economic interests... sort of a Catch-22 situation.","time":1668438170,"type":"comment","_id":"RGlQKKZe7bcCPTyz"}

The functionality of it is great and the execution is sharp.<p>However, my main gripe with Deno is that it&#x27;s tied to one company and it won&#x27;t solve issues that it doesn&#x27;t have. As an example of this, a version of nodes cluster module is not supported so there is no way of running one deno process per cpu which is very bad if you&#x27;re hosting it yourself and want to utilize the full potential of your hardware.<p>It also means that if your app is bound to some CPU heavy action, like generating a large excel-file or similar, your app will go down since no requests will be processed due to the single thread nature. Of course, such actions can be solved with a web worker but what if you make a coding mistake which renders an unhandled exception? In this case the app would probably go down and if the end user for example does the same action over and over again (which end users tend to do in frustration), the app will go down again and again.<p>Deno as a company has probably little interest in solving this as the solution is to run it on their paid service. You could of course have several servers hosting the app, but that gets expensive real quick especially if you are a small shop. Another example is to run the entire app process as web workers but then you need to spin up many processes that all have their own ports which you need to add a load balancer in front of it. This is kind of advanced and adds unnecessary complexity to the app IMO.<p>Also, if Deno the company company fails, what then will happen to Deno the project?","time":1668436110,"type":"comment","_id":"SHOheXeHwhUyHScJ"}

At their peak, Nokia launched 46 models a single year [1]. I believe Apple has launched somewhere &lt;35 models of iPhone in the fifteen years of its existence. Part of the problem was, companies like Nokia couldn&#x27;t conceive thinking that there could be one model that&#x27;s good for everyone. Like music? You need to get a music phone like XpressMusic. Business person? Get N97. Low on budget? Get the simple 1108. The proliferation of models just spread expertise, and marketing dollars, and ended up diluting both. Instead of making one awesome phone, you have tons of mediocre models.<p>The genius of Steve Jobs was in showing that you can have whole company focus on making a brilliant device that works for everyone. I still don&#x27;t get why companies are so much focused on launching hundreds of different models instead of  one and leveraging economies of scale.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;shubhamjainco&#x2F;status&#x2F;1406338323531010050\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;shubhamjainco&#x2F;status&#x2F;1406338323531010050</a>","time":1668438185,"type":"comment","_id":"UxVkQAZMCvG0FHL3"}

Apple&#x27;s <i>true</i> definition of privacy is that All Apple&#x27;s user Data belongs to Apple. Any data to third party are by definition &quot;Tracking&quot;. Since Privacy is a <i>Fundamental Human Right</i>, I guess the only choice is to give Apple all your Data?<p>6. Most people, especially tech nerds will likely play the I trust Apple more than Google card. Because Apple are not in the Ad business! - That was 2017 to 2021 if not 2022. They have their ads business right infront of you for a long time. They have been preparing their Ads business for a long time.

That was just a few weeks before MtGox fell.<p>Then there was ANX&#x2F;ANXPro. Everything was fine for a while.

Engineering will use JIRA. And Product will use some generic roadmap-first tool like Asana, Trello, Miro, Monday, or MS Project. Product will beg everyone to use their tool, but no one will because it&#x27;s for looking at work, not executing on it.<p>Product will not understand because we Product Managers don&#x27;t actually DO things, we talk to people, organize ideas at a coarse level - and we have a simple tool that articulates the vision perfectly! Except it doesn&#x27;t automatically integrate with the CI&#x2F;CD pipeline, it doesn&#x27;t automatically log the last touch with a high-priority prospect, it doesn&#x27;t pass designs from the designer to the UX engineer. It doesn&#x27;t actually DO anything. It becomes just another SaaS platform in our Okta stack that only the PMs look at - and it gets out of sync with the actual reality reflected in the other SaaS offerings.<p>And the reason it doesn&#x27;t do those things is because the people who built it thought that THEY were the ones who could build the all-in-one project management tool and all those sales people, engineers, designers, lawyers, and marketing writers would log in to theirs. Insert relevant XKCD about standards here. The truth is no PM tool will ever be the system of record for the actual work, but everyone is afraid that the complexity of integrating with others will turn them into JIRA.<p>So we get these vaguely opinionated ways of moving around and arranging candy-colored cards, and those cards never quite show us the state of the project we are managing, so we have to bug people to &quot;update their status in &lt;Monday&#x2F;Asana&#x2F;Trello&gt;&quot; before the weekly meeting.

This is a point that Jim Gray made in the classic &quot;The 5 Minute Rule for Trading Memory for Disc Accesses&quot; (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpl.hp.com&#x2F;techreports&#x2F;tandem&#x2F;TR-86.1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpl.hp.com&#x2F;techreports&#x2F;tandem&#x2F;TR-86.1.pdf</a>) back in 1986.<p>A side effect of that is that systems that run faster, and therefore access each cached it more often, get more benefit out of a cache by pushing that set point out further. Whether that happens in any given system depends a lot on the access patterns, and especially temporal locality within those access patterns, but the effect is real in a lot of different kinds of systems.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s common wisdom that systems with caches can fail badly when the caches are cold. When every request misses the cache, the system is overloaded, and never recovers. What I observed was the mirror image.<p>The bottom line is that both locality and memoization are huge contributor to the performance of systems, both positive and negative. When folks (including me) point out the risks of caches, we&#x27;re not implying that caches are always bad. Instead, it&#x27;s pointing out a risk that sometimes they are too <i>good</i>, leading to a system that can&#x27;t function when the normal level of locality and memoization are not available.","time":1668444345,"type":"comment","_id":"XuuUrr7ppcmnOjjN"}

I&#x27;ve seen enough crappy screenshots of Twitter in YouTube videos to last me the rest of my life.<p>2. If your device does sub-pixel anti-aliasing, then your screenshots all have noticeable color fringing around their text. The text rendering is done well before the data hits the buffer that the screenshot is capturing. A fun party trick is to identify someone&#x27;s OS based purely on a screenshot of some text on a webpage.<p>3. On Linux (and maybe elsewhere, IDK), color correction (e.g. gamut mapping) is done (in X11) before the pixels get to the buffer that you capture. So with most screenshot tools, you end up capturing a bunch of distorted colors which you then have to map back to sRGB if you want them to look right in color calibrated software.<p>You can frequently get away with printing a PDF and then rendering that out to a large PNG. In some cases, though, figuring out how to set the page size to match what you seen on the screen can be near-impossible, and more importantly in Firefox there&#x27;s no way to disable print media CSS when printing a PDF.

{"by":"Errancer","id":33593780,"parent":33593349,"text":"Eh, this article touches on something important but 1. the material aspect of determinism is the most boring one, if everything is materially determined then so is our feeling of freedom therefore it doesn&#x27;t really change anything. Strawson has a nice article about this called &quot;Freedom and resentment&quot; which shows that the thesis of determinism doesn&#x27;t really change anything about our ethics. 2. the programming lingo seems to me to make the issue more obscure rather than clear but the problem he is mentioning is discussed under the name &quot;second-order desires&quot; and is quite important since it leads to much more interesting problem of determinism - the psychological determinism. Usually we believe we have certain freedom in choosing our beliefs through weighing and choosing our interpretations of what is happening. The issue of psychological determinism is threefold. First proposition is that our beliefs change due to some causes, they don&#x27;t simply pop into our head. Second proposition is that our given beliefs will dictate what interpretations will make sense to us. Therefore every cause will make us believe what our current beliefs allow. Third proposition is that our actions are driven by combination of beliefs and desires. So ultimately we can&#x27;t chose our actions since we can&#x27;t choose our beliefs and the hope for &quot;freedom&quot; is lost. What is left is the will which is not free but driven by beliefs and desires that are outside &quot;our&quot; control.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know if I believe in this formulation of the problem but among all formulations of determinism throughout history this one is in my opinion the only one worth arguing about. I learned about it by reading two texts by Bernard Williams and I would say that he should be named the author of this formulation even though he never used such name. The first text is his book &quot;Ethics and the limits of philosophy&quot; and the second is the essay &quot;How free does the will need to be?&quot;. If someone is interested in this issue then I would recommend following the citation trail of the essay.","time":1668433565,"type":"comment","_id":"YK5jPzSaU6vzMeQd"}

One step you could try is reaching out to any recruiters you may have added over the years and ask them if they know of any open positions you might be a good fit for. If you haven&#x27;t added any you might be able to look in your feed to see if there are any advertising jobs and reach out to them from there.<p>I know LinkedIn and recruiters get kind of a bad rap but I really like working with them over applying the old fashioned way.<p>You get more phone calls but it beats filling out forms. If you get multiple recuriters working on your behalf you can setup situations where you try to interview for lots of companies at once in batches. If you&#x27;re currently unemployed and have the time for that, some companies will eliminate time consuming steps in their interview process to hire you before one of the other companies does.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked in the last few months but this is most of my strategy for finding good jobs without having to bother with annoying things like job applications or too many interviews.<p>Long term an additional thing you can do to boost this is continue to add recruiters on linkedin even when you&#x27;re not actively looking.<p>I don&#x27;t enjoy the job search, so I let the recruiters do it for me.<p>You can be pretty straightforward with them too because they&#x27;re incentivized to get you a job with commissions. You might be surprised with what they come back with if you tell them very explicitly what you&#x27;re looking for (money, remote, type of interview, etc). Of course the more recruiters you work with the more likely some of them will be able to turn up these roles.<p>I also like this system because it ensure you are only working with companies extremely motivated to hire. At the point where a company has hired an external recruiter, they have already spent thousands of dollars to try to hire you, failed, and now they&#x27;re spending thousands more in commission to send someone out into the wild to find them someone they can please hire.<p>One last thing I&#x27;ll throw out if you&#x27;re still having trouble past that or if that strategy is unpalatable to you.

It started with a 2-4 week delay each release cycle while they fixed caching bugs the testers had found, but once I joined the project I saw how deep the problem went.<p>A number of their features invited a full table scan, which is fundamentally incompatible with an LRU cache, and in particular has disastrous stair step functions as the working set grows. Note that this is also a couple of years before anyone had heard of memcached so these were DIY implementations with multiple potential sources of bugs.<p>About the time I found my feet on the project someone wanted to add caching to yet another workflow that was taking 30 seconds to run. It was an admin workflow so there was a little tolerance of slow response times, but not 30 seconds.  I volunteered for the story because I thought we could do better than more caches.<p>Through conversation, step debugging, and profiling I found the spot where they had wanted the caching. What the feature was doing was two relatively expensive lookups of the same data, filtering it on two very different dimensions, and returning the intersection of the two. In typical ORM fashion, both of the concerns were taking it upon themselves to fetch their own data instead of having it handed to them. Since they were both called from the same function, I hoisted the lookup out of the callee into the caller, sending the same list to both. Then I changed the code again to feed the result of call 1 to call 2, to make it work more like consecutive filters.<p>The end result was that the page now loaded in 3 seconds, and I was able to write better unit tests for this code. One might expect that most of that improvement came from running the second filter on a much smaller list, but that&#x27;s where you&#x27;d be wrong. The majority of that improvement came from the hoisting, not the chaining. Due to the amount of work in the filters, the initial lookup shouldn&#x27;t have accounted for more than a third of the page load time, but just sharing the same data dropped the response time to around 6 seconds. Chaining the filters ended up only saving 3 seconds.<p>The problem with large data sets is that CPUs have caches too. And in a garbage collected programming language, there are additional costs to carrying around duplicated data, particularly if it is in tree form like this was. Most likely we were smashing the hell out of CPU caches and introducing extra GC pressure to boot. By passing in the same object tree the second call followed warm and&#x2F;or hot paths through heap memory.<p>I&#x27;d had a similar but less dramatic experiences a few years before that, where I identified that a function, which accounted for 10% of the runtime, was being invoked roughly twice as often as the problem required. By that point 5% looked like low hanging fruit, so I eliminated the duplicate calls and reran the benchmarks. But the results didn&#x27;t make sense so I tweaked and prodded and fiddled. The new time was 20% lower than the old time, for what should have been 5%. This is already way too long so I won&#x27;t go into the reasons here, but in addition to the scenarios I mentioned for the previous issue, there&#x27;s also problems of timing accuracy in profilers, and cyclic use patterns that can misattribute the expense of a call to siblings or the parent. A function that creates many objects may never reach the GC threshold, but a large allocation later in the sequence diagram may. Or collide with cache lines that are needed again later in the call graph.","time":1668449290,"type":"comment","_id":"ddwNsvZfe3P23cv0"}

Don&#x27;t be gaslit by all the people insisting that it&#x27;s still a gold rush.  It&#x27;s not that there aren&#x27;t jobs out there, but many companies right now are either laying off employees, under hiring freezes, or simply aren&#x27;t that serious about hiring besides through nepotism.  Since I got started as a software developer full time 9-ish years ago, I&#x27;ve been relentlessly blasted with messages from various recruiters.  In the last 6 months, recruiter activity has slowed to a crawl, and I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s something wrong with me.  Back when I chose to stop working for almost a year, I still got plenty of recruiters reaching out to me.<p>To add to your point about resumes, people need to not underestimate the power of networking.  Networking has been the key factor to my advancement for the last 3 jobs. It&#x27;s just the way things are.  People want to work with developers who aren&#x27;t dicks, and interviewing is a time suck for both interviewees and interviewers.  Today I was informed by a colleague that someone he was interviewing couldn&#x27;t write a basic loop.  Though the need for mere competence is reduced significantly, it&#x27;s definitely still there.<p>Another thing to consider is to find companies that actually have a real profit model and apply to those.  This is not the time IMO for feeding from the trough of easy money, because that whole phenomenon appears to be hitting a wall.","time":1668451169,"type":"comment","_id":"dqPzoJfpatkIKTLC"}

Having an audience in mind can help to keep you on track towards completing a project. Eg: if you&#x27;re doing graphic design work for a friend or are running an advertising campaign for a small community, there&#x27;s often a clear end to when it&#x27;s done. Things like open source project maintenance, on the other hand, can get trickier to cut off, depending on the project and its goals, so I have only chosen those on occasion<p>I often don&#x27;t return to a project to keep it going in the same way since my projects are meant to be bite-sized. They will satisfy a curiosity or creative need, then I can move onto something else<p>That said, a break can also help to pivot on a previous project in some way. For example, maybe I want to create a library to experiment with HTML5&#x27;s AudioContext API to try out some software synthesis. Once that&#x27;s in a ready state, I could consider that complete, then focus on creating a UI to interact with it as a new, separate project<p>Overall, the thing that helps the most is keeping a schedule. It doesn&#x27;t have to have hard deadlines (at least not all the time), but in keeping projects small enough without getting too simplistic, it helps to keep the projects satisfying without turning into a chore while giving me a sense of accomplishment as well as new things to look forward to","time":1668451301,"type":"comment","_id":"gbwlyEg0e3kT9SWc"}

Here&#x27;s the second-to-last paragraph:<p>&gt; Alternatively you could switch to a regular expression engine that doesn’t exhibit this kind of behaviour. RE2 is an excellent library that uses a finite automata approach to avoid this type of catastrophic backtracking. Using this library on the same 32 character input reduces the running time from 12 minutes to basically instant. The downside being that RE2 doesn’t support all the functionality of the builtin re package.<p>Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (the flavor used by most engines, including Python&#x27;s) _require_ this exponential worst-case behavior (using an implementation called backtracking). But the theory behind regex does not require this, and if you eliminate just a couple (infrequently used) features of PCRE, you can have a regex engine that runs in linear time (with respect to the size of the input string). See [2], this is by the authors of RE2. The features which are incompatible with this sort of implementation are:<p>1. Lookahead assertions.\n2. Backreferences to matched groups.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what these are, or you rarely ever use them, then you really have no business using this kind of regex engine. (And if you are using them, then I&#x27;d argue you&#x27;re shoving a bit too much logic into a regex, but that&#x27;s beside the point). Nonetheless, every popular programming language (except Go[1]) has included an exponential backtracking regex implementation in their standard library, and exposed the entire industry to this stupidity, all for a few backreferences and lookahead assertions.<p>What&#x27;s especially crazy is this: it&#x27;s easy for a regex engine to <i>detect</i> the use of these constructs, because it has to parse the regex anyway! So it&#x27;s feasible for the engine to optimistically try to use an efficient implementation, and only fall back to using a backtracking implementation when you&#x27;re actually using these features. This is what the Python re2 module[3] does, it uses RE2 by default and supports falling back to the backtracking implementation if necessary.<p>Instead, we&#x27;re stuck reading the same postmortem every few years describing how &quot;catastrophic backtracking&quot; ruined another company&#x2F;person&#x27;s day, when the problem has been solved for decades, and language&#x2F;library creators have just failed to include that solution.<p>[1]: Rob Pike invented, or at least popularized, the algorithm used by RE2.

{"by":"whartung","id":33599641,"parent":33593631,"text":"I&#x27;ve had 4 &quot;aha&quot; moments in my computing career, well 5. 3 are from books.<p>My 5 &quot;ahas&quot; were expressions and assignment in BASIC. Arrays, and how they work. Dynamic memory, i.e. the first time I got a linked list to work in Pascal. Networking as a streaming service combined with &quot;how Unix works&quot;, which was mind blowing. And, finally, lambda.<p>The first was my science teacher introducing me to the computer. He did this and that, and left me to flail helplessly for several hours before I gave up and went home. The next day he showed me BASIC expressions, again, &quot;aha&quot;, and it stuck.<p>Next, was arrays. Did not grok arrays at all. And all of the example were something about &quot;balancing a check book&quot; (I&#x27;m 14, like I care a wit about balancing check books). But eventually, after typing in enough &quot;101 BASIC GAMES&quot;, arrays clicked. I can&#x27;t recall, which game, but I credit one of those BASIC game books for that aha.<p>I don&#x27;t consider my dynamic memory aha to be book based. I&#x27;m sure I got it from some data structures book in theory, but pulling it off in Pascal was just a combination of raw effort and figuring it out with friends. It&#x27;s an aha moment because visualizing the linked list, or tree exploding in your mind from the very few lines of code necessary to pull it off was, well, aha indeed.<p>Network streaming and Unix came in one hit. I&#x27;d been doing Unix application development for some time, but our machines and client machines were all standalone. But I was at another office and I saw a guy do, essentially, `cpio -xyz folder | rsh cat &gt; &#x2F;dev&#x2F;tape` (yes, rsh -- does that date it?) And that really blew my mind. The idea of piping across the network to a streamable device. Wow. Very, very aha.<p>Finally, lambda. Always fascinated and interested in Lisps and what not, but I seem to be genetically coded against groking anything Greek outside of a Gyro sandwich. I&#x27;ve always hated reading texts that use the Greek alphabet for, well, anything. Because whenever I see a Greek letter, I assume that it must be conveying something beyond a simple unknown variable. People choose those letters for a reason, I just don&#x27;t know what it is. So, θ is used not just to represent a variable, but to represent an angle (always seems in trig, they use θ). So, if you see θ, perhaps it also means that it&#x27;s an angle of somekind.<p>Anyway, right or wrong, I assume that&#x27;s whats happening and I simply don&#x27;t know the &quot;meta&quot; of why, when, or how a Greek letter is chosen. And this hold true for Lambda.<p>Lambda was chosen because of its inspiration from lambda calculus (which I also don&#x27;t know). So, if you know lambda calculus, you &quot;know&quot; what lambda means. I don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;d be bouncing along in some Scheme or Lisp test and they start dropping those on my head and, well, my pooh brain doesn&#x27;t grok it and I&#x27;d abandon it.<p>Then, I stumbled upon the book &quot;Simply Scheme&quot;. What does &quot;Simply Scheme&quot; do? First thing they do, is they rename everything. Like &quot;first&quot; instead of &quot;car&quot;. They just started with their own vocabulary and presented Scheme that way. Well, heck, I knew what all those words mean, maybe not the specific semantics in Scheme, but the general definition, and so the first few chapters were very successful in communicating the underlying themes of Scheme. Including things like anonymous functions (for which they used the word, I think, of all things, &quot;function&quot;).<p>Later they conflate &quot;lambda&quot; and &quot;function&quot;. Basically, &quot;lambda&quot; mean &quot;anonymous function&quot;.<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; &quot;Aha!&quot;, and the clouds parted, the seas calmed, the sun came out and like getting a few select Tetris pieces, the board cleared and a LOT of things made much more sense right away.<p>Aha indeed.","time":1668454419,"type":"comment","_id":"tViCTdithCqFEROK"}

And there&#x27;s another dimension if it&#x27;s possible: the amount of effort required, which might be measured in years (and what if you&#x27;re old and bound to fail?)<p>Personally, I find it simpler to go epicurian and if I find something new I enjoy (right now, Russian rap lol) just enjoy it without asking myself too many questions.<p>And if I don&#x27;t like something or have no want for something I should like (Drill rap, Trap rap), I don&#x27;t force myself but don&#x27;t exclude it out of my life either: I leave that to serendipity :)","time":1668444977,"type":"comment","_id":"wptq4o17tRbosi47"}

There is no way for someone to be a true &quot;expert&quot; in many technologies&#x2F;languages, and if you get specific questions about these technologies, you will be exposed (something that happened multiple times when I was interviewing).<p>2) Pay attention to what tools the job requires and tailor your resume&#x2F;cover letter accordingly.

That being said, if you don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with what we use, make it clear that you are willing to learn. We know that we will not always get someone who meets every requirement.<p>3) As amazing as it is to have to say this; be courteous and communicate. For instance, if something comes up and you can&#x27;t make an interview time, let the company know ahead of time; ghosting will hurt you.<p>4) If you don&#x27;t do well on a code test (Leetcode, TestDome, etc), don&#x27;t blame the platform for not doing well.

Never hurts to look around and being ready to interview will reduce the amount of time to find another job in the event you end up in the next round of cuts. Some of my coworkers are leaving for higher paying jobs without there having been any risk of layoffs at my company. Otherwise if you weren’t part of the initial cuts, you are probably fine and remember layoffs come with a few months severance so you’re already getting a few months of runway in the worst case.","time":1668439857,"type":"comment","_id":"zpzlbj2AuOxSZoWg"}
