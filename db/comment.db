Ask a film editor about &quot;work hours&quot; and they will either laugh, or cry.  Let&#x27;s not normalize the 18-hour day!<p>Second, you should feel good about even worrying about this: it means you&#x27;ve got some ethics.  But you shouldn&#x27;t feel like you owe &quot;flow state&quot; for every hour you bill.  Do you need to take a walk to clear your head and better concentrate on the problem?  That&#x27;s work.  Lunch isn&#x27;t that much harder: is it a working lunch?  Bill it.  Are you having a nice long lunch in order to not think about work, or maybe meeting friends?  Don&#x27;t bill it.  (Day&#x2F;etc. Rate obviates this problem.)<p>Third, socializing with the staff is a little complicated if you&#x27;re billing hourly, or sometimes even daily.  I would be pretty happy if a contractor went out for social food&#x2F;drinks with my employees, but I would much prefer to pay for that in good will than in actual billed hours.

It has just enough of what I want of modern language conveniences that I&#x27;m not sad about using it. I certainly derive some happiness from having a zero impedance inclusion on the iOS and server side; conversely, were I to use Rust, my early reading seemed to indicate I&#x27; have to navigate a bit of FFI and library inclusion on the iOS side that I&#x27;d much prefer not to.<p>So, at hobbyist level, it&#x27;s been fine. If I were to go purely on technical merits and language niceties I would have chosen Rust, as the depth of language features and standard library features is really really nice for me, but the fact that I can just have something that <i>works</i> in either of my desired platforms has made it okay to deal with a slightly less mature (IMO) ecosystem.<p>Also, as a note, I&#x27;ve done just a tiny bit of SwiftWASM with this same toolset, and it&#x27;s not bad either.

{"by":"Errancer","id":33593780,"parent":33593349,"text":"Eh, this article touches on something important but 1. the material aspect of determinism is the most boring one, if everything is materially determined then so is our feeling of freedom therefore it doesn&#x27;t really change anything. Strawson has a nice article about this called &quot;Freedom and resentment&quot; which shows that the thesis of determinism doesn&#x27;t really change anything about our ethics. 2. the programming lingo seems to me to make the issue more obscure rather than clear but the problem he is mentioning is discussed under the name &quot;second-order desires&quot; and is quite important since it leads to much more interesting problem of determinism - the psychological determinism. Usually we believe we have certain freedom in choosing our beliefs through weighing and choosing our interpretations of what is happening. The issue of psychological determinism is threefold. First proposition is that our beliefs change due to some causes, they don&#x27;t simply pop into our head. Second proposition is that our given beliefs will dictate what interpretations will make sense to us. Therefore every cause will make us believe what our current beliefs allow. Third proposition is that our actions are driven by combination of beliefs and desires. So ultimately we can&#x27;t chose our actions since we can&#x27;t choose our beliefs and the hope for &quot;freedom&quot; is lost. What is left is the will which is not free but driven by beliefs and desires that are outside &quot;our&quot; control.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know if I believe in this formulation of the problem but among all formulations of determinism throughout history this one is in my opinion the only one worth arguing about. I learned about it by reading two texts by Bernard Williams and I would say that he should be named the author of this formulation even though he never used such name. The first text is his book &quot;Ethics and the limits of philosophy&quot; and the second is the essay &quot;How free does the will need to be?&quot;. If someone is interested in this issue then I would recommend following the citation trail of the essay.","time":1668433565,"type":"comment","_id":"6fcH3gqtTjLqabrE"}

This is a point that Jim Gray made in the classic &quot;The 5 Minute Rule for Trading Memory for Disc Accesses&quot; (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpl.hp.com&#x2F;techreports&#x2F;tandem&#x2F;TR-86.1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpl.hp.com&#x2F;techreports&#x2F;tandem&#x2F;TR-86.1.pdf</a>) back in 1986.<p>A side effect of that is that systems that run faster, and therefore access each cached it more often, get more benefit out of a cache by pushing that set point out further. Whether that happens in any given system depends a lot on the access patterns, and especially temporal locality within those access patterns, but the effect is real in a lot of different kinds of systems.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s common wisdom that systems with caches can fail badly when the caches are cold. When every request misses the cache, the system is overloaded, and never recovers. What I observed was the mirror image.<p>The bottom line is that both locality and memoization are huge contributor to the performance of systems, both positive and negative. When folks (including me) point out the risks of caches, we&#x27;re not implying that caches are always bad. Instead, it&#x27;s pointing out a risk that sometimes they are too <i>good</i>, leading to a system that can&#x27;t function when the normal level of locality and memoization are not available.","time":1668444345,"type":"comment","_id":"6hbAskShcJ0TUq3m"}

I increasingly see the wisdom of languages with implicit reference semantics.<p>It&#x27;s not that value semantics can&#x27;t be better (they most assuredly can be), or that reference semantics don&#x27;t cause their own complexity problems, but rather that so often we thoughtlessly imply&#x2F;impose value semantics through interfaces in ways that negatively impact performance;  getting interfaces wrong is a much tougher bell to unring.<p>The vast majority of my mental energy when I define an interface in C++ is carefully thinking through a combination of ownership contracts and value vs. reference semantics that I can mostly ignore in languages with implicit reference semantics. While occasionally ignoring those contracts while developing in Java&#x2F;Python&#x2F;whatever comes back to bite me, the problem isn&#x27;t nearly as common or problematic as when I unintentionally impose value semantics in a language that allows me to.","time":1668444821,"type":"comment","_id":"7D37BvNKblMBB3rn"}

His ideas enable end users (residents) to be able to change their built environment while still maintaining a cohesive architectural design. Sadly, his groundbreaking ideas on pattern languages became watered down into HOA design regulations; software engineers did not heed what he talked about in that keynote; and Human Computing Interaction design dropped end-user-customizable software (like Hypercard) in favor of designs that favored aggregators, because it is more profitable (not necessarily more resilient, or better for society)","time":1668461740,"type":"comment","_id":"8oSzQXtSGVjryWew"}

I find that the usual optimisations in three aspects are usually obvious to achieve and can bring surprisingly big improvements.<p>The first is that RAM accessed randomly or in the wrong direction performs very poorly compared to sequential access in order. The same is true of cache because its much easier to predict and prefetched data when its accessed serially. The effect is so dramatic that its sometimes worth &quot;accessing&quot; data you don&#x27;t need to get access to this hardware optimisation to maintain serial access. At times for example I have found Treemaps and listmaps perform better than hashmaps as the cheap search serially and in memory order surprisingly out does the O(log(n)) or O(n) algorithms and the cost of the hash.<p>If you have a data structure that is larger than optimal and overflows cache lines it can have big impacts on cache utilisation and performance if the algorithm doesn&#x27;t need all the fields. Object orientation impacts quite heavily on this and certain designs can make very large objects and these often get poor cache usage.<p>Unnecessary allocation and deallocation of memory in algorithms often results in the cache getting thrashed and avoiding this and using the same memory can result in better hot cache usage and reducing garbage collection usage.<p>Most profilers can give you a good idea of the allocations but the other two are often harder to find and mostly just show up in cache misses.","time":1668448048,"type":"comment","_id":"90XAPSLgOWLxhg6A"}

{"by":"whartung","id":33599641,"parent":33593631,"text":"I&#x27;ve had 4 &quot;aha&quot; moments in my computing career, well 5. 3 are from books.<p>My 5 &quot;ahas&quot; were expressions and assignment in BASIC. Arrays, and how they work. Dynamic memory, i.e. the first time I got a linked list to work in Pascal. Networking as a streaming service combined with &quot;how Unix works&quot;, which was mind blowing. And, finally, lambda.<p>The first was my science teacher introducing me to the computer. He did this and that, and left me to flail helplessly for several hours before I gave up and went home. The next day he showed me BASIC expressions, again, &quot;aha&quot;, and it stuck.<p>Next, was arrays. Did not grok arrays at all. And all of the example were something about &quot;balancing a check book&quot; (I&#x27;m 14, like I care a wit about balancing check books). But eventually, after typing in enough &quot;101 BASIC GAMES&quot;, arrays clicked. I can&#x27;t recall, which game, but I credit one of those BASIC game books for that aha.<p>I don&#x27;t consider my dynamic memory aha to be book based. I&#x27;m sure I got it from some data structures book in theory, but pulling it off in Pascal was just a combination of raw effort and figuring it out with friends. It&#x27;s an aha moment because visualizing the linked list, or tree exploding in your mind from the very few lines of code necessary to pull it off was, well, aha indeed.<p>Network streaming and Unix came in one hit. I&#x27;d been doing Unix application development for some time, but our machines and client machines were all standalone. But I was at another office and I saw a guy do, essentially, `cpio -xyz folder | rsh cat &gt; &#x2F;dev&#x2F;tape` (yes, rsh -- does that date it?) And that really blew my mind. The idea of piping across the network to a streamable device. Wow. Very, very aha.<p>Finally, lambda. Always fascinated and interested in Lisps and what not, but I seem to be genetically coded against groking anything Greek outside of a Gyro sandwich. I&#x27;ve always hated reading texts that use the Greek alphabet for, well, anything. Because whenever I see a Greek letter, I assume that it must be conveying something beyond a simple unknown variable. People choose those letters for a reason, I just don&#x27;t know what it is. So, θ is used not just to represent a variable, but to represent an angle (always seems in trig, they use θ). So, if you see θ, perhaps it also means that it&#x27;s an angle of somekind.<p>Anyway, right or wrong, I assume that&#x27;s whats happening and I simply don&#x27;t know the &quot;meta&quot; of why, when, or how a Greek letter is chosen. And this hold true for Lambda.<p>Lambda was chosen because of its inspiration from lambda calculus (which I also don&#x27;t know). So, if you know lambda calculus, you &quot;know&quot; what lambda means. I don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;d be bouncing along in some Scheme or Lisp test and they start dropping those on my head and, well, my pooh brain doesn&#x27;t grok it and I&#x27;d abandon it.<p>Then, I stumbled upon the book &quot;Simply Scheme&quot;. What does &quot;Simply Scheme&quot; do? First thing they do, is they rename everything. Like &quot;first&quot; instead of &quot;car&quot;. They just started with their own vocabulary and presented Scheme that way. Well, heck, I knew what all those words mean, maybe not the specific semantics in Scheme, but the general definition, and so the first few chapters were very successful in communicating the underlying themes of Scheme. Including things like anonymous functions (for which they used the word, I think, of all things, &quot;function&quot;).<p>Later they conflate &quot;lambda&quot; and &quot;function&quot;. Basically, &quot;lambda&quot; mean &quot;anonymous function&quot;.<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; &quot;Aha!&quot;, and the clouds parted, the seas calmed, the sun came out and like getting a few select Tetris pieces, the board cleared and a LOT of things made much more sense right away.<p>Aha indeed.","time":1668454419,"type":"comment","_id":"99vjg2u7VNkvbEQp"}

(Audio book, radio, stream, podcast, whatever.)<p>Ditto identifying songs (Shazam!).<p>I don&#x27;t want to fart around with exchanging contact information. My hands are usually full or whatever. Just say &quot;Robert, contact info&quot; and then repeat out loud whatever I hear.<p>I also want to rewind after the fact. When trying to recall a tidbit, I&#x27;ll remember the song, where I was (eg while walking the dog), who I was with, what I was eating. So if I want to remember which podcast I was listening to while at the park, I&#x27;d just start with my location log and jump over to my podcast listening log.<p>What could be more simple?<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m still waiting for my &quot;bicycle for the mind&quot;.<p>PS- I&#x27;ve tried, half-heartedly, to use the voice recorder app, and notes with voice transcription. But then it quickly becomes a treasure hunt. And my attempts to do this stuff with Siri just leaves me more frustrated.<p>Thanks for listening.<p>Great project.

Theoretically, maybe, but in practice, no. This is kind of a paradox. Even though we can conceive of infinitely many things, any particular thing will be guessable in a finite number of questions. After all, the answerer can only reach so far into the infinite depths of the universe before they decide on a thing</i><p>It&#x27;s probably not like the answerer has access to more than, say, 1M things - I mean as things they can juggle in their mind and pick among.<p>Let&#x27;s say recording artists: there are 100s of thousands of them globally. But a regular person will perhaps know&#x2F;recall at best 100-1000 max distinct ones, even if they have heard 2x or 3x others. And they&#x27;d be the most likely another would know too.<p>Or let&#x27;s take numbers: those can be constructed (you don&#x27;t need to know a number ahead of time to think of it - I can think of 2345324532435245 but I didn&#x27;t have that in mind as something I&#x27;ve encountered already, I just know that that would be a number, I just need to pile on digits to come up with one). So, yes, this would overflow the &quot;set of items to pick&quot;. But &quot;I&#x27;m thinking of the specific number X&quot; is not commonly or ever part of the 20 answers game.<p>(Still, if the first N questions make it clear that it&#x27;s a number that was picked, the next 20 - N ones could try to binary search it).<p>Or let&#x27;s consider animals and insect: there are 20,000 types of beetles alone. But nobody will put an unknown &quot;beetle type X&quot; (say, &quot;Sitophilus granarius&quot;) as the item they think. They&#x27;ll either think of &quot;beetle&quot; in general, or at best some well known beetle type.<p>One insight is that if the other person doesn&#x27;t even know of the thing you have in mind, or is not fun guessing it with questions (like a specific huge number), then it makes no sense to pick it, as part of the implicit game rules is for others to have a chance and everybody to have some fun (as opposed to &quot;win at all costs&quot;).","time":1668505259,"type":"comment","_id":"CG8ZM159XD813w52"}

There are some tricks to <i>avoiding lag in presentation</i> for accounts with huge numbers of followers, but there decentralisation already serves to turn a flat list of followers into a tree of instances -&gt; subsets of followers per instance, and <i>if&#x2F;when</i> any instances gets to a size when scaling a single instance becomes problematic, then decomposing into a virtual federated set of instances presenting a unified namespace solves that just fine (have built a mail setup doing just that - mapping &lt;user&gt;@&lt;domain&gt; to &lt;user&gt;@&lt;backend shard&gt; is not hard)<p>The issue of &quot;unpaid Labour&quot; and peoples lack of desire to self host also depends on an assumption that Mastodon is inherently tied to unpaid volunteers or self hosting, but you can <i>already</i> pay for Mastodon hosting, and more options are sure to appear if it keeps growing.

At the end, it advocates for a market-oriented centralization approach. Throughout, it calls out problems that seem to be features.<p>The analogy to decentralized package hosting seems misaligned. If a package repo disappears, it breaks a tree of dependencies. If a social media instance disappears, the followers (the &quot;dependencies&quot;) can adapt without being disrupted. This seems like a feature.<p>On the issue of &quot;not agreeing what it should look like,&quot; this also seems like a feature. Communities can use the platform to self-organize according to their own visions and priorities. Surely, someone who has spent time exploring the various instances available can quickly identify this. Not agreeing what it should look like is what makes it what it is. Not having to force everyone to agree what it is, is what it is. Again, it&#x27;s a feature, and something fediverse users have happily &quot;learned to live with,&quot; and moreover, embraced.<p>Moderation and illegal content are a legitimate challenge on any platform. With the decentralized fediverse, everyone handles it according to their own policies. This does mean some admins allow it perhaps more than they should, but it also means they face the consequences directly. Admins who work to keep it out do face a daunting task in many cases, but there are tools for it. And a process of sort of natural selection already seems to favor those who have the resources and energy and motivation and skill to do it well. Seems, again, like a feature.<p>&quot;Mastodon is old.&quot; Not sure how this has anything at all to do with centralization or decentralization. We all use things that are old. Many old things work great. As far as others not getting their changes merged back, well, that&#x27;s the benefit of forking and open source. Anyone who wants changes that aren&#x27;t part of the upstream can fork it and make those changes. If enough people like them, people will move to the fork. It happens all the time. Feature.<p>Technical challenges described are demonstrably surmountable.<p>Market-based approach: well, we&#x27;re living it, and Mastodon in particular is succeeding in the market. There are competitors like Pleroma and microblog.pub. If enough people decide Mastodon proper has &quot;fucked up too much,&quot; then there are others right behind it ready to &quot;step in and replace it.&quot;<p>I dunno. There are arguable advantages to centralization, but I&#x27;m not sure this article touches on them, or at least not convincingly. Rather, it seems like the main complaints, if they&#x27;re not in fact addressed by the design and operation of the fediverse, are design choices that give the fediverse advantages in other aspects. In any case, I don&#x27;t see how the claim of the headline is well-supported by the points raised in the article.","time":1668443275,"type":"comment","_id":"G67lkYQyNY6lrJ2Q"}

So one should take care if simply switching some code from values to pointers-to-values.<p>All of these things are things that coders with more experience of languages that use such semantics kinda know already, almost as second nature, since the first day they got caught out by them.

Honestly for me it is relatively trivial to find clients with shoestring budgets versus adequate ones.<p>But ideally you set things up ahead of time by finding a client with a decent sized budget and then charging by the week. The billing increment is one week.<p>Then just make sure to have regular delivery or discussions as often as possible with the client. They should see the deliverables progressing, even if it&#x27;s just the architectural details being worked out at first. They should be judging based on useful things obviously happening and being explained or being able to use the next version rather than just looking at hours to try to guess whether they are getting a good deal or something.<p>For me, we will see how it goes. Right now I have a weekly billing client who I am a bit worried I will have to replace because things in this niche are so dead right now. But there were a few other projects I may be able to pick up. I am definitely going to try to find one that can afford a week or two though because realistically all of the projects have gone on for more than two weeks so far, generally speaking more like 2-8 weeks each.<p>When it&#x27;s going to almost certainly take a month to complete a project, trying to get out of an extra hour every day or something is a questionable strategy because it&#x27;s a significant investment anyway,  and the biggest risk really is most projects just not delivering usable software at all, which means all of that money gets wasted.","time":1668528860,"type":"comment","_id":"HWF3EbY59OQIgktV"}

Is that an error path or a success path?  It’s both!  The logic is “if we found a rule <i>or</i> if there was an error then return a tuple that hopefully indicates the outcome”.  If any further code were to be added in this block, it would have to be validated for the success and the error case.<p>But this only makes any sense at all if one is okay with reading Go result returns in their full generality. A canonical Go function returns either Success(value) or Error(err not nil, meaningless auxiliary value).  And this code has “meaningless auxiliary value” != nil!  In fact, it’s a pointer that likely escapes further into unrelated error handling code and thus complicates and kind of lifetime or escape analysis.<p>I don’t use Go, but if I did, I think this part of the language would be my biggest peeve.  Go has very little explicit error handling; fine, that’s a reasonable design decision.

In any case, I&#x27;m obviously inclined to agree that they&#x27;re both weird games, and that the weirdness comes from their fundamental asymmetry.

In it, he argues that, at the time of writing (late 50s), the industrialized West has largely solved what had previously been the main preoccupation of economics - improved standard of living. As evidence, Galbraith points to advertising.<p>The argument is simple: when important productivity improvements take place, say the invention of a new way of baking bread, they don&#x27;t need advertising to gain mass use. Their benefits are so obvious that they don&#x27;t need to be sold. Demand doesn&#x27;t have to be created, because demand comes from human existence.<p>The existence of advertising, in contrast, shows that the thing being advertised probably isn&#x27;t that important. Indeed, the item is so trivial as to require advertising to create demand for it. This then leads us to wonder what benefit is being served by both creating this product and the demand for it; Galbraith argues that we&#x27;ve essentially fetishized economic growth at all costs (a holdover, in his view, from the early days of econ which was concerned with our metaphorical bread making instead of our metaphorical advertised widget making). He then attacks planned obsolescence as the dumbest outcrop of this process, because now we&#x27;re purposefully wasting materials on things which we hope to replace in the near future for no reason other than to keep making the things, things which we don&#x27;t need anyway - as evidenced by the fact that they&#x27;re advertised.<p>Anyway I think this fits in perfectly with the whole influencer economy phenomenon, because that&#x27;s literally all they do. Their raison d&#x27;etre is to generate demand for items nobody needs or even previously knew about.","time":1668530081,"type":"comment","_id":"RcLER8CvZIw8brJf"}

Suddenly the idiotic examples of cars, vehicles and bicycles or animals, cats and dogs were unloaded from my mind and OOP really sinked in.<p>* Java for Dummies - Also unlikely place to look for answers, but TTD and OOP made sense when I read the book many years ago.

They reduce the number of things to learn. You can refresh your memory on the spot, you can learn (if you have experience) an entire language over one weekend or maximum one week.

There&#x27;s no technical reason why it couldn&#x27;t be great for server-side development but there are two major reasons I wouldn&#x27;t expect it. First, there&#x27;s no painful gap to drive adoption. Go and bit by bit Rust are both reasonable statically typed, compiled languages with good ergonomics and performance. Second, there isn&#x27;t a strong community of corporate and individual developers supporting use outside of iOS. That means few people, but also little tooling. I was excited by the extensibility and some of the stuff the TensorFlow team was doing but there just doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough reason to pick Swift over one of the more mature alternatives. Even on Apple&#x27;s own platforms there&#x27;s only full support for the latest macOS release. I&#x27;m guessing the calculation is that iOS is a big enough carrot to keep a community of Swift developers around and Apple doesn&#x27;t see growing beyond that as a priority.

For now, we can’t reconcile general relativity and quantum mechanics, so I really don’t feel we have very strong evidence that it is—thinking it computable seems like an article of faith as well. We also have Godel’s incompleteness theorem—even if it appears we can model the universe as something computable, I think there’s going to be room for mystery, and human consciousness seems like just the sort of strange self-referentiality eddy where that kind of thing would come in to play. I think a lack of free will be unfalsifiable--you&#x27;d have to measure all aspects of a brain, including the quantum state, which would change what you observed--so maybe then you can predict it, but you also had a hand in determining it, which undermines what you want to know, that it was determinable.<p>On the other hand, free will seems to just refer to the feeling you <i>could’ve</i> made a different choice. But you didn’t. I don’t see why people get so defensive about a junk concept. At some level, it doesn’t really seem like there are separate things, and I don’t feel like there’s a need to invoke some kind of separate individual free will aside from the operation of a universal stoicism type logos&#x2F;the totality of natural law operating as something like a universal “will”","time":1668482894,"type":"comment","_id":"UR90wUdf0jIUtrfT"}

{"by":"Archelaos","id":33603707,"parent":33593349,"text":"This little piece reminds me of Thomas Hobbes&#x27; &quot;Of Liberty and Necessity&quot; (1646, publ. 1654).[1] Hobbes would have very probably rejected the recursive application of &quot;want to&quot; onto itself as nonsense, but uses a very similar structured chain of reasoning as the author when it comes to &quot;necessary causes&quot;:<p>&quot;... But here I must take notice of certain words of his Lordship&#x27;s in this place, as making against his own tenet. Where all the causes, saith he, being joined together, and subordinate one to another, do make but one total cause, if any one cause, much more the first, in the whole series or subordination of causes, be necessary, it determines the rest, and without doubt maketh the effect necessary. For that which I call the necessary cause of any effect, is the joining together of all causes subordinate to the first, into one total cause. If any of these, saith he, especially the first, produce its effect necessarily, then all the rest are determined. Now it is manifest, that the first cause is a necessary cause of all the effects that are next and immediate to it, and therefore by his Lordship&#x27;s own reason all effects are necessary.&quot; (p. 261)<p>This &quot;joining together of all causes subordinate to the first, into one total cause&quot; is not far away of applying the tactics of a regular expression.<p>Instead of a chain of &quot;wants&quot;, Hobbes speaks of &quot;alternate succession of contrary appetites&quot; and only the last one is what we call &quot;will&quot;. In this view, the author&#x27;s example of the drug adict would have been irrelevant for the problem. An adiction merely describes a (psychological) habit. However, the analysis of &quot;will&quot; is always about a specific, individual event and everything that leads to it, which can often include diverse intentions:<p>&quot;... I conceive that in all deliberations, that is to say, in all alternate succession of contrary appetites, the last is that which we call the will, and is immediately next before the doing of the action, or next before the doing of it become impossible. All other appetites to do, and to quit, that come upon a man during his deliberations, are called intentions and inclinations, but not wills, there being but one will, which also in this case may be called the last will, though the intentions change often.&quot; (p. 273)<p>In Hobbes view a &quot;voluntary action&quot; is an action where somebody was deliberating. Only in this sense the person has a choice. And if the person is &quot;free&quot; to do something, this means that the process of deliberating is still ongoing:<p>&quot;... I conceive that those actions, which a man is said to do upon deliberation, are said to be voluntary, and done apon choice and election, so that voluntary action, and action proceeding from election is the same thing ; and that of a voluntary agent, it is all one to say, he is free, and to say, he hath not made an end of deliberating.&quot; (p. 273)<p>Therefore the freedom of the will is in accordance with determinism (&quot;necessary causes&quot; in Hobbes&#x27; terminology), which is itself unavoidable:<p>&quot;... I conceive that nothing taketh beginning from itself, but from the action of some other immediate agent without itself. And that therefore, when first a man hath an appetite or will to something, to which immediately before he had no appetite nor will, the cause of his will, is not the will itself, but something else not in his own disposing. So that whereas it is out of controversy, that of voluntary actions the will is the necessary cause, and by this which is said, the will is also caused by other things whereof it disposeth not, it followeth, that voluntary actions have all of them necessary causes, and therefore are necessitated.&quot; (p. 274)<p>Hobbes&#x27; argumentation in &quot;Of Liberty and Necessity&quot; has far more interesting details and touches a lot more related topics than I could have presented here. For those who want to delve deeper into the philosophical discussion on the freedom of the will, I highly recommend the text as a basic read.<p>[1] See: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;englishworkstho28hobbgoog&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;englishworkstho28hobbgoog&#x2F;</a> [pdf] (pp. 229-278)","time":1668473540,"type":"comment","_id":"UhsuHAs4GDa6iPpH"}

It&#x27;s too sensitive and tends to brake shockingly hard during fairly mundane maneuvers.<p>When backing up near a wall&#x2F;obstacle, the auto-brake seems to kick in when anything is closer than three or four feet away from the bumper. I use my mirrors and have an accurate impression of where the four corners of the vehicle are - I don&#x27;t need the computer slamming on the brakes when I am reversing in a tight spot. It feels _more_ dangerous and I fear that one day, my knee-jerk reaction will be to fight the machine (press the gas harder, or get distracted looking at the console which emits lights and sounds every single time auto-brake kicks in) and wind up wrecking with even more force than I might have otherwise.<p>Also, in traffic, I&#x27;ll often take my foot off the gas and coast&#x2F;idle, letting the vehicle slow down naturally. I try to do this instead of braking sometimes as I believe it assists with keeping the flow of traffic predictable for others. Usually this is no problem because I leave at least three car lengths of space before the next person.<p>Sometimes, while decelerating, I will allow the distance between myself and the next car to close, for example, if they&#x27;re turning and will be gone in a second anyway. The Subaru then ruins my well-calculated slowdown maneuver by slamming on the brakes because it thinks I&#x27;m approaching the vehicle ahead of me too quickly. Well, yes, maybe, but they&#x27;re also halfway out of the lane already so it&#x27;s not terribly significant that I&#x27;m closing the distance at speed. Another half-second and they&#x27;ll be gone, restoring my follow distance.<p>I wish there was a way to fine-tune the sensitivity, or at least an option to say &quot;I am an attentive driver, please switch auto-brake to a lower sensitivity level.&quot; Currently the only option is to disable it each time the engine starts, which feels wrong to do...","time":1668526445,"type":"comment","_id":"VyvMk0YmIItpXLQX"}

{"by":"hinkley","id":33598255,"kids":[33598551],"parent":33596546,"text":"About 15 years ago I was on a team that was having so many problems with caching that I began to see it for the liability that it is. It started with a 2-4 week delay each release cycle while they fixed caching bugs the testers had found, but once I joined the project I saw how deep the problem went.<p>A number of their features invited a full table scan, which is fundamentally incompatible with an LRU cache, and in particular has disastrous stair step functions as the working set grows. Note that this is also a couple of years before anyone had heard of memcached so these were DIY implementations with multiple potential sources of bugs.<p>About the time I found my feet on the project someone wanted to add caching to yet another workflow that was taking 30 seconds to run. It was an admin workflow so there was a little tolerance of slow response times, but not 30 seconds.  I volunteered for the story because I thought we could do better than more caches.<p>Through conversation, step debugging, and profiling I found the spot where they had wanted the caching. What the feature was doing was two relatively expensive lookups of the same data, filtering it on two very different dimensions, and returning the intersection of the two. In typical ORM fashion, both of the concerns were taking it upon themselves to fetch their own data instead of having it handed to them. Since they were both called from the same function, I hoisted the lookup out of the callee into the caller, sending the same list to both. Then I changed the code again to feed the result of call 1 to call 2, to make it work more like consecutive filters.<p>The end result was that the page now loaded in 3 seconds, and I was able to write better unit tests for this code. One might expect that most of that improvement came from running the second filter on a much smaller list, but that&#x27;s where you&#x27;d be wrong. The majority of that improvement came from the hoisting, not the chaining. Due to the amount of work in the filters, the initial lookup shouldn&#x27;t have accounted for more than a third of the page load time, but just sharing the same data dropped the response time to around 6 seconds. Chaining the filters ended up only saving 3 seconds.<p>The problem with large data sets is that CPUs have caches too. And in a garbage collected programming language, there are additional costs to carrying around duplicated data, particularly if it is in tree form like this was. Most likely we were smashing the hell out of CPU caches and introducing extra GC pressure to boot. By passing in the same object tree the second call followed warm and&#x2F;or hot paths through heap memory.<p>I&#x27;d had a similar but less dramatic experiences a few years before that, where I identified that a function, which accounted for 10% of the runtime, was being invoked roughly twice as often as the problem required. By that point 5% looked like low hanging fruit, so I eliminated the duplicate calls and reran the benchmarks. But the results didn&#x27;t make sense so I tweaked and prodded and fiddled. The new time was 20% lower than the old time, for what should have been 5%. This is already way too long so I won&#x27;t go into the reasons here, but in addition to the scenarios I mentioned for the previous issue, there&#x27;s also problems of timing accuracy in profilers, and cyclic use patterns that can misattribute the expense of a call to siblings or the parent. A function that creates many objects may never reach the GC threshold, but a large allocation later in the sequence diagram may. Or collide with cache lines that are needed again later in the call graph.","time":1668449290,"type":"comment","_id":"ZIun0UlNYmJPCCOx"}

His answer was to liken it to a man in a boat rowing in a river. The river has a current, however man has effort. I believe his verdict was &quot;effort is greater than destiny&quot;.<p>Perhaps it has to be so, because were it not, then we are just part of the clockwork creation.<p>PG is trying to go one level deeper in his post. Namely, are we living under the illusion that we have free will, because our free-will (which is essentially our ability to have agency over our environment) is itself a product of our desires, and now the question is are our desires our own or are they themselves determined?<p>It may not be possible to know the answer to this one.

{"by":"LinuxBender","id":33595259,"kids":[33595466],"parent":33594961,"text":"The article goes into some details beyond scaling that I can resonate with.  I had a few forums and IRC servers in the past that grew rather large.  I eventually shut them down, not because of scalability but because of legal liability and dealing with the myriad of personality issues that put my domains at risk.  Scaling a forum or IRC to hundreds of thousands or even millions of people is not hard especially nowadays with cloud scaling and the current state of modern kernels and hardware.<p>What I found too challenging was having to moderate the content and finding moderators that could be trusted to remove illegal content in a timely manor.  Worse, there were trolls that would use bots to post highly illegal material and then automatically submit their own posts to my registrars, server providers and government.  The bots somehow even grabbed screenshots right after they posted content.  I say bots because there was no way a human to perform their actions so quickly.  This was a losing battle and I did not have the legal resources to deal with it, nor the development resources to play the cat and mouse arms race 24&#x2F;7.  I do have my own conspiracy theories as to who these bot owners were but that doesn&#x27;t matter any more.   Nowadays I could probably block more of those bots with techniques I have learned but I just do not have the desire to get back into that quagmire.<p>I suspect some of the Mastodon admins will learn this lesson with time.  They, like me, will probably start in a state of denial and dismiss the risk until it <i>gets real</i>.  And it certainly gets real.<p>The only technical work around I could find was to set forums to make all posts moderator-approved, meaning only the poster can see their post until a moderator approves it.  This does not scale and people want their posts to be instantly available.  With IRC I had to constantly add new file sharing domains to word filters to block the links to illegal material and that was also a losing battle.<p>[Edit] BeefWellington brings up a good point.  I should add that I am referring to public instances of forums and IRC servers that anyone may join.  Private servers are at much lower risk assuming the trusted members are good at setting strong passwords and static content is not accessible at all without an account and Mastodon servers are not linked to lesser trusted or non-private instances.","time":1668439308,"type":"comment","_id":"af8Gzx1MBa8Qt1M6"}

Two decided to walk out and were able to text me a nav point that I was able to meet them at (took all day to get there because of the snow and mud, but I made it and was able to pick them up). The other two stayed up there, and we sent probably 100 texts back and forth coordinating what turned into like 3 solid days of fighting to get up there with snowcats and get them back down.

The other half of the equation is that you really need to be able to send texts. The SOS button is very expensive. Extremely expensive. That will keep a lot of people from using it. (Yes insurance exists, but hardly anyone has it). Being able to text your friends for help is substantially more useful. Being stuck on a backroad with no service, 5, 10, 20 miles from where anyone can be expected to drive by is a far more common scenario than breaking your leg at the top of a mountain and needing to be evacuated.","time":1668527271,"type":"comment","_id":"alJHhiE7JxUyXZNZ"}

There are many elements and many causes, and you have to address those things, and not the procrastination.<p>Willpower is similar - people talk about willpower like it is a substance that is used up to motivate decisions. That is a human experience, but any particular decision has it&#x27;s own motivations. If you have consistent issues with a type of decision, look into your motivations and deeply held beliefs, look into the elements of that motivation; defer judgement about yourself during this process.<p>These things about mentality can&#x27;t be conveyed with words, your mind has to come to them on it&#x27;s own, but hopefully reading this will make the ideas more available to you.","time":1668434965,"type":"comment","_id":"cZCPmGnOU208JSj8"}

Similarly, instead of select crsql_finalize() you should use INSERT INTO crsql VALUES (&#x27;finalize&#x27;).

Modern fiber cables can contain up to a thousand fiber strands in a single cable although the highest strand-count single-mode fiber cable commonly manufactured is the 864-count, consisting of 36 ribbons each containing 24 strands of fiber.

Some movements come from the distrust of governments or taxation, others come from the distrust of central services.<p>This isn&#x27;t framing the problem the fediverse is solving accurately. What fedi solves isn&#x27;t not trusting anyone, because it&#x27;s not a fully P2P network. Rather, it&#x27;s more about having accountability for the services you use. With a massive centralized social media platform like Twitter where it needs to effectively scale up to be able to accommodate the entire world, it&#x27;s impossible for a service like this to exist without either being run by a government or a corporation. In the US, the two are more or less the same anyways since we&#x27;ve outsourced most of our infrastructure to the private sector and have been doing that for decades. And in the case of a private entity controlling one of these services that need to scale massively, it&#x27;s effectively impossible for them to not be incentivized to do all the things that make people not trust them -- mining users&#x27; data, etc.<p>On fedi, you know who your server admins are; they&#x27;re human beings that you can message if you have a dispute with another user, or there&#x27;s an issue with the service itself, or whatever. If an instance admin does something shitty, they can be held accountable for it and can have their reputation ruined on fedi, which isn&#x27;t a perfect system since it leads to things like people being defederated unjustly, but I would say it&#x27;s far more scalable socially to have a patchwork of different small to medium sized servers run by individuals or teams of people rather than faceless corporations that largely automate all of their user-facing interactions (algorithmic bans and support) where it&#x27;s basically impossible to hold them accountable for anything unless you have millions of dollars to burn in court.<p>It is true that centralization&#x2F;decentralization are implementation details for solving a problem, but this is a case of technological solutions not being sufficient for cultural problems and vice versa. Fedi, for all the problems I have with it, is however closer to striking a balance between solving problems on both of these fronts because it returns the internet to being a community-driven network that has its own culture, and has more ability to handle bad actors or failures in the network with federation as opposed to earlier eras in the internet where for example everyone was using their own separate forums and the centralization of the internet onto social media platforms was really an inevitable consequence of that structure of the internet.","time":1668464919,"type":"comment","_id":"iUH0Ldym6JQLYh5w"}

Torrent systems and Mastodon are both decentralized and distributed. Twitter is both technically and socially centralized. Reddit is technically centralized but socially federated, and contrary to popular intuition a lot of cryptocurrencies are centralized, global state machines on distributed hardware, not actually decentralized socially which would defeat their purpose for existing.<p>What people are after in social networks increasingly is local communities. Whether it runs on protocols or platforms doesn&#x27;t really matter. I&#x27;d agree though with the authors and Moxie&#x27;s take that protocols have a lot of problems due to their slowness and technical hurdles. In reality they also tend to coalesce into platforms anyway due to economic pressures.<p>The most appealing quadrant for social networks I think is the Reddit one. Some platform with a baseline and minimum of largely legal rules but local moderation. Which is essentially how real world federations work anyway. If it&#x27;s a new or existing one I don&#x27;t know but I could well imagine that Twitter or Facebook more and more devolve power towards regional communities and create better and fine-tuned moderation tools.

Instances are not guaranteed to keep existing, they depend entirely on a citizen running it, scaling it, and paying for all that, often with the help of donations. Even a relatively small influx of new users may pose an existential financial threat for the instance, or a lock so that nobody new can join.<p>Even when things are running &quot;normally&quot;, instance owners may simply quit. Further, did you know that almost every instance regularly purges all media attached to toots?<p>Your instance, content within it, account you created within it, the media attached to your toots, are all incredibly fragile and can disappear at any time. The main Mastodon scaling approach: creating lots of small instances, makes this problem worse, not better. You&#x27;re just spreading fragility.<p>You don&#x27;t have this insecurity at Twitter, not at this fundamental level. Twitter pretty much auto-scales and your content is not lost. Sure, people may get banned, but a normy user would normally not face these existential issues.<p>The other thing that scales poorly is moderation. Twitter is sometimes perceived as being inconsistent in its rules (or biased), but this is a 100 times worse on Mastodon. Every instance has their own arbitrary and ever-changing rules. The same applies to federation. Instance mods regularly block federation with other instances based on arbitrary decisions.<p>Technically, the UX is inconsistent. One instance may work well whilst the other has page loads into the 10 seconds, or federated content delayed by hours.<p>Doesn&#x27;t scale, fragile, and deeply inconsistent. It has a place and I still consider Mastodon an accomplishment. But it should not be compared with any of the centralized services.","time":1668443423,"type":"comment","_id":"mBVTejxdi6URvL3s"}

They waste more time in meetings. And they lack focus. The easiest way to fix broken teams is to remove people from them. You don&#x27;t have to fire them. Just put them in other teams or create some new teams. This does wonders for cutting down on the stress levels, heated debates, and other wasted energy that plague overstretched teams with too many captains on the ship.<p>I would not even wait for problems to emerge. Just split big teams on principle. Minimum size of 3. Maximum size of 7. One eight person team then becomes two teams of 3,4,or 5 people. Make sure each team has a tech lead that knows what they are doing.<p>Don&#x27;t over-staff teams with managers&#x2F;minders&#x2F;scrum masters&#x2F;whatever label you slap on junior management. This causes a big problem: managers like to hoard people to inflate their importance. You deflate their team and you deflate their ego and they&#x27;ll be forever whining to &quot;fix it&quot; with more &quot;resources&quot;.<p>Simple solution: give them more than 1 team to manage and direct them to keep their teams small. Now they count teams instead of people. Or teams and people. And you can measure their success as a function of how well their teams are performing.<p>Then if those teams get overloaded, you have a conversation about which new teams are going to be needed and who is going to manage them. Any new team should be bootstrapped with mostly existing people: you move people around and promote them. New people start out in existing teams. This accomplishes two important things: people have a perspective of getting promoted sideways and new people learn the ropes in a small well functioning team rather than being dumped in an overstretched team.","time":1668507485,"type":"comment","_id":"mtSoAJyQ8wMFBt4h"}

I think this is a fundamental difference of the fediverse. There is no one experience, and that&#x27;s a feature not a bug.<p>I think it also makes out that by banning other instances outright, instances will be largely disconnected. I think this ignores that, more or less, people agree with what is acceptable and what is not. And if they don&#x27;t largely agree, maybe those groups of instances should be disconnected.<p>I think it also assumes that this disconnected experience is somehow opaque to users, when I think it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out that you&#x27;re only seeing Toots from your own server. I think that&#x27;s also not a bad thing. Again, if you set aside the idea that everyone has to be on the same experience, viewing the same content, the decision calculus becomes easy. Are you happy with the depth and breadth of the content you&#x27;re seeing? No? Then move instances (which is easy).<p>My other criticism is about legality. The US has section 230 of the telecoms act, which basically allows internet companies to moderate their websites, without having to be responsible for what is posted there by users. Basically, the argument that the law will somehow sink the fediverse ignores that we made it this far. The web was allowed to flourish, in part because what you say online is largely your responsibility, not the responsibility of the sites that host the content (with a few exceptions).

This is great for as long as they genuinely are too big to fail and you can assume that someone will always step up to save the day. But the Java ecosystem went through a case where that didn&#x27;t happen: JCenter&#x2F;Bintray was a popular Maven hosting site for many years until one day the operator simply announced they didn&#x27;t want to run it anymore and shut it down. It was a clean, phased shutdown but ultimately enormous numbers of builds and projects did have to migrate away. Now everything is even more centralized around Maven Central, which really is (hopefully) too big to fail.<p>The financial system has a lot of experience with dependency on centralized organizations that are too big to fail. It&#x27;s trading one set of problems for another. In particular the risk is that the organization starts to &quot;fail&quot; but not badly enough to cause a mass collective shift away. Things just degrade and become terrible but there&#x27;s never a moment that overcomes the enormous activation energy needed to migrate away.

It seemed like there was no reason to do anything and no reason not to do anything. The level of nihilism I sunk to led to all sorts of unhappy consequences.<p>I am still prone to those lines of thought sometimes, but with experience, I can also suggest ways to defuse the nihilism and existential angst so they don&#x27;t continue to lead to suffering for yourself and people around you.<p>1. Concepts like &quot;free will&quot; are ill-defined, so there is actually no problem to solve. Stop itching at problems which are complete bullshit. Focus on lived experience, not vague distractions.<p>2. Even if there is no freedom, you can still experience suffering, and it is possible to learn to avoid paths which lead to suffering. The learning might be deterministic, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t experience the results. Or, just continue to suffer if you&#x27;re too stubborn to learn. Your ... choice, or whatever you want to call it, when you insist on shooting yourself in the foot even after you learned it hurt.<p>3. Responsibility is not the same as free choice. Responsibility is a contract where you agree to take on the bad consequences if something bad happens, and in return you gain power over what you are responsible for. One of the paths which leads to suffering is to assume you&#x27;re not responsible for your actions. There are lots of ways people try to abdicate their personal responsibility. Excuses like &quot;it was drugs&quot; or &quot;I was treated badly&quot; or &quot;my brain is controlled by the laws of physics so I can never really choose anything&quot; or &quot;it was so-and-so&#x27;s fault.&quot; Whether or not these things are true, you are still admitting defeat and allowing disempowerment and suffering into your life whenever you say something was not your responsibility. Hemingway was on the right track when he resolved to always honor promises he made while drunk. To do otherwise is to admit that your actions were out of your control; it invites intrusion and censure by those who see you as weak for not being able to take responsibility. Every time you blame someone or something else for a problem, you grant them power which you could have kept for yourself, if only you had owned the problem.","time":1668473374,"type":"comment","_id":"tVcAkYAgnQQa15m1"}

Nick Chater wrote an interesting book a few years ago called <i>The Mind is Flat</i> in which he made the case that a lot of deep perceptions about ourselves are wrong. We literally just make most of it up as we go along. He went through lots of examples but one is this kind of thing[1]. How many dots are there on the grid? Weirdly enough more than you can see. When you see an entire image full of color turns out a good deal of that is also made up, as most of that visual perception only ever happens in the center, your brain filling in the rest.<p>Point being, perception is inherently constructed, and that probably does apply to perception of your own cognition. Elaborate notions of wants and free choice are likely rationalizations just as your mind goes along and does its thing. It puts a sort of empirical limit on your confidence which I think is more productive than these linguistic rabbit holes about wants of wants of wants.<p>[1]<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;b&#x2F;be&#x2F;HermannGrid.svg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;b&#x2F;be&#x2F;HermannG...</a>","time":1668473244,"type":"comment","_id":"twxrNyTNYAlIdbBe"}

Here&#x27;s my little story.  I&#x27;m 37 and was never a runner, but last October a friend dragged me out for a run.  We ran a 5K straight-up (at ~6m:30s&#x2F;KM).  It&#x27;s not a &quot;couch to 5K&quot;, as I&#x27;m lean and bicycle a lot (&quot;zone 2&quot; cardio) as part of my daily life, eat healthy, and put in many walks and some hikes over the past 3 years.  So the &quot;infrastructure&quot; is in place.<p>This year I ran two half marathons (one in Bruges last month), and went for another &quot;half-marathon forest hike&quot; last weekend:<p>I had no <i>idea</i> I could run these longer distances, and was not even <i>planning</i> to run.  I activated this &quot;latent&quot; potential by a happy accident.  Earlier this February, when talking about running with a friend of a friend, she casually said &quot;why don&#x27;t you register for the half-marathon at this gorgeous nature trail[1]?&quot;  I said, &quot;hmm, I never ran more than 7K, and the half-marathon is only 50 days away.&quot;  &quot;Just register, you&#x27;ll do fine!&quot;, she said.  I did register, and diligently trained for exactly about 45 days.<p>Lo and behold!  I completed the first <i>half</i> marathon in April in 2h:12m; and the second one last month in 2h:9m. Both of them without stopping.  I&#x27;m still surprised by myself.  If that acquaintance hadn&#x27;t pushed me a little bit, I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with half-marathons.  Now I&#x27;m hooked.  I&#x27;m calling my next half-marathon &quot;cracking 2&quot; (running it under 2 hours).

No good answers there. China has this fixed, but they don&#x27;t do anonymity. You need a government ID to connect to anything.<p>Storage is the big cost problem.

Swift hasn&#x27;t taken off outside of the Apple ecosystem, which is of course heavily client focussed.
